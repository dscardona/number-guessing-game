# Welcome user to game
# I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100: randomly select a target number, save as target
# Select level: hard or easy. if hard: 5 attempts if easy 10 attemps
# Ask player to make a guess, compare to target, print clue, take input again (loop)
# if tries expire: you lose
# if guess = target before tries expire: you win
#play again?
